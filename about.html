        <h3>Our Vision</h3>
        <p>
            We envision a world where no child is left without care, where orphaned children

    <!-- History -->
    <div class="about-history">
        <h3>Our History</h3>
        <p>
            OrphanLife Foundation was established with a simple but powerful idea:
            to give orphaned children a place they can truly call home.
            What began as a small initiative to support a few children has grown
            into a trusted organization serving many vulnerable children over the years.
        </p>

        <p>
            In its early days, the orphanage focused on providing basic necessities such as
            food, clothing, and shelter. As the needs of the children evolved, so did our work.
            We expanded our programs to include education support, healthcare services,
            emotional counseling, and life-skills development.
        </p>

        <p>
            Through the dedication of our founders, staff, volunteers, and supporters,
            OrphanLife Foundation continues to grow and adapt, ensuring that every child
            under our care receives not just support, but a real opportunity for a brighter future.
